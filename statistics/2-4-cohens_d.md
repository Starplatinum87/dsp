[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

# Code
`CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)`

# Analysis
- When compared with each other, it looks like there is a much greater difference in weights versus pregnancy lengths. The effect for weights is about 4x that of pregnancy lengths.
- However, when evaluated against Cohen's chart for evaluating effect size, both effects fall within the "Small" range, so both effects would be considered rather small. 
- You can also evaluate just as a standard deviation and 8% of a standard deviation is a quite small difference.
